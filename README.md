#This is a repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

One can use the run_analysis.R script to execute the instructions from the Course Project. All necessary files are also available in the repo.

The final output is in a file called "courseproject.txt". You can view the output in R using the following code:

results <- read.table("courseproject.txt", header = TRUE)

View(results)
